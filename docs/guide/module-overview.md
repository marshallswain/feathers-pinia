export { clearStorage } from './clear-storage'
```

## Stores and Model Classes

- **`setupFeathersPinia`** allows global configuration of `clients` for all apps. It can also be used to support a common set of options for the returned, wrapped `defineStore` function. Right now it's not that useful for SSR apps, which require an alternative configuration.
- **`defineStore`** sets up a single Pinia store for a single Feathers service.
- **`defineAuthStore`** sets up a single Pinia store for an authentication service. See [Auth Stores](./auth-stores)
- **`BaseModel`** is the base class for working with [Data Modeling](./model-classes).
- `makeServiceStore` is an internal utility that assists in structuring service stores. Don't use it.

## Global Reference Objects

- **`clients`** stores a reference to every Feathers client provided to either `setupFeathersPinia` or `defineStore`.

  - After setup, you can reference a `FeathersClient` at any time as shown below. This might come in handy if you need to fetch data that you don't want to be reactive. That data also won't end up in the store, so it would require refetching if not manually stored somewhere. You could use this with [swrv](https://docs-swrv.netlify.app/).

  ```ts
  import { clients } from 'feathers-pinia'
  const { api } = clients

  const result = await api.service('items').find({ query: {} })
  ```

  - If you call your default client `api`, you won't have to provide a custom `clientAlias` option to the `defineStore` function. Learn about setting up FeathersClient instances in [Setup](./setup).
- **`registerClient`** adds a client by name to the `clients` object.  `registerClient('api', feathersClientInstance)`.

- **`models`** stores a reference to every custom model provided to `defineStore`.

## Common Tools

- **`useFind`** gives you reactive data by providing it with a set of `params` like what you would pass to a Feathers service's `find` method. This provides smart SWR (stale while revalidate) functionality, which we generally refer to as a fall-through cache. The cool thing with `useFind` is that since it uses the `findInStore` getter under the hood, it can show records from other queries that match with the current query. Learn more in [useFind](./use-find).
- **`useGet`** gives you a reactive `get` request. Like `useFind`, it's basically a fall-through cache, only its for individual records. Learn more in [useGet](./use-get).
- **`usePagination`** is a composition api utility that handles typical pagination logic. See [usePagination](./use-pagination)
- **`handleClones`** removes boilerplate from the [clone and commit pattern](https://vuex.feathersjs.com/feathers-vuex-forms.html#the-clone-and-commit-pattern). It automatically clones all component props containing a `feathers-pinia` instance and provides a handy `save` function for each one. The `save` function performs automatic diffing to only patch data that has changed. See [handleClones](./handle-clones)

## Storage Sync

- **`syncWithStorage`** synchronizes specific parts of a store's state into `localStorage` or any storage adapter you provide.
- **`syncWithStorageCompressed`** is just like `syncWithStorage`, but it uses LZW compression to fit roughly 10MB of data into the 5MB localStorage limit. The downside is that the data is unreadable in devtools, so you generally only would use it for production.
- **`clearStorage`** just clears data stored with the above utilities.
